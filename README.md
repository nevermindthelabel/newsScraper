# newsScraper

In this project our goal is to create a web app using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) for server side scripting, [Express](https://expressjs.com) for our simple web server, [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) as a semantic template engine, [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as an ORM for MongoDB, [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) to grab CSS selectors from the DOM easily, and [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for http requests.

The goal of this project is to allow the end user view and comment on news stories scraped from other sources, and have the data stay in the database so users can view their notes without having previous notes get blown away when new data comes in.
