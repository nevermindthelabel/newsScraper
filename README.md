# newsScraper

In this project our goal is to create a web app using [express](https://expressjs.com), [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/), and [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

The goal of this project is to allow the end user view and comment on news stories scraped from other sources.
